            Lorraine Makuyana is a junior at Ashesi University in Ghana. Her major is Computer Engineering
            and she is on track to graduate in June 2022. Lorraine is a technology enthusiast who aspires to be a 
            Software Engineer. She is very passionate about aviation and spacecraft, and with that, she aspires to 
            develop software that will be implemented in these fields someday. Lorraine is also passionate about women 
            empowerment and gender equality, and it is because of this that she started an initiative called My Vision
