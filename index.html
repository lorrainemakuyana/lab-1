    <h1>Lorraine Makuyana</h1>
    <p>
        I am a junior at Ashesi University studying Computer Engineering but with a strong 
        interest in Computer Science. I am passionate about women empowerment, girl-child advocacy and 
        technology, not forgetting entreprenuership. I am the founding president of My Vision Initiative, a 
        start-up organization that seeks to drive passion and ambitions of teenage girls in Zimbabwe. <br> 
        My hobbies include swimming, travelling and eating.
